# u-Unwrap3D Analysis Notebooks

This collection of [Python](https://www.python.org/)
[jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks are written for Python users who are interested in 
analyzing three dimensional images of cells, tissues, organoids and organisms acquired using modern fluorescence microscopes. 

## Structure of this Jupyter book

The chapters of this book initially cover basics in Python, image processing and image analysis. 
Afterwards more advanced topics are covered including machine learning and statistics.
The order of the chapters reflects typical image analysis workflows, starting at image visualization, filtering and segmentation, followed by feature extraction, tabular data wrangling, statistics, plotting and data visualization. 
At the beginning of every chapter, basic terminology is introduced and installation instructions for the required Python libraries covered in this chapter are presented. 
The notebooks aim to be self-contained, self-explanatory and fully reproducible. 
Hence, the reader can download this Jupyter book and execute all notebooks as they are. 
As a general requirement, a conda environment should be present on the reader's computer as explained in the first chapter.
