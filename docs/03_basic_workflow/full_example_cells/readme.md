# Full examples of standard workflow

We apply the standard workflow that was described in detail in this chapter to each of 3 different cells with 3 different surface morphologies to show how it is implemented in one script in practice. These examples cells were segmented from microscopy images using [u-Segment3D](https://github.com/DanuserLab/u-segment3D/tree/master) and using its [tutorial scripts](https://github.com/DanuserLab/u-segment3D/tree/master/tutorials/single_cells). We will work with only the surface meshes for generality.
